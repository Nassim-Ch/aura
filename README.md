# aura â€“ an interactive light sculpture
## Description
"aura" is a kinetic light sculpture which represents a living being whose behavior is controlled by technology. Interactions bring it to life: It changes its shape through air pressure and shifts its colors. In this way, it reveals its feelings to explorers.
The sculpture breathes into its silicone membranes. Sterile-looking air tubes flow into an organic, mystical creature and breathe life into it. This opens up a level of understanding between man and machine. We learn to communicate with it and discover its emotional world.
